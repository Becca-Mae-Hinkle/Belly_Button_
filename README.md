# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Description
The client for this project is wanting to take her study of belly button microbes and how 
they might colonize to produce a suitable synthetic beef taste.

The dashboard we have created includes:

* dropdown to examine data from each individual
* bar chart featuring the top ten microbial species (OTUs or operational taxonomic units)
* bubble chart featuring all microbial species
* gauge of the frequency of belly button washes per week
